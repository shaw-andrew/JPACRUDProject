# JPACRUDProject

## Description
This was an individual full-stack CRUD project. It encompased the entire project from the ground up. I had to create a SQL database as well as populate the tables. I condigured the JPA project and mapped the entities to my SQL table. I included JUnit testing to verify the JPA mappings were executing correctly. I utilized Spring MVC and ultimately this project will be deployed on AWS. 

This project in particular utilized the SQL database to store information about Dog parks. The landing page is a list of the current "inventory" of dog parks, but the user can add, remove, update and read with full access to the database.

## What I learned
This project was similar to last weeks project, however utilizing the Spring Framework allows for much easier mapping and significantly drier code. While much of the CRUD operations were the same, I used some spare time this weekend to expand my knowledge of CSS and Bootstrap to make for a better looking page. I'm still new with image manipuation and figuring out how everything plays together, but I'm proud of the product I was able to make this week.

## Technologies Used
Java, AWS EC2, SQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Spring, Git

## How to run
The code is all available on Github. It has also been deployed on EC2 at http://52.32.118.35:8080/DogParks/index.do
